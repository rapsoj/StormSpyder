StormSpyder is a web scraping tool designed to access the latest tropical storm data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), detectng strike probabilities for tropical storms, tropical cyclones, and hurricanes up to nine days in advance. This information is then cross-referenced with a 2.5km resolution population map, producing calculations of the expected impact of the storm event on local populations. Results are then emailed to key parties.
